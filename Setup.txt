======================
= INSTALLING Node.js =
======================

Install project dependencies (node_modules)

This project depends on external Node.js packages.
The "node_modules" directory is NOT included and must be generated.

Steps:
1) Install Node.js (LTS version) from:
   https://nodejs.org

2) Open a command prompt in the project directory
   (the directory that contains "package.json").

3) Run:
   npm install

This will create the "node_modules" directory automatically
based on "package.json" and "package-lock.json".

Do NOT create "node_modules" manually.
Do NOT edit files inside "node_modules".



==========================
= CREATING THE .env FILE =
==========================

You need to create a file named ".env" next to "index.js".
It will contain the following lines.

TWITCH_USERNAME=yourusernamehere_insmallletters
TWITCH_OAUTH=a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j9k0l1m2n3o4
CHANNEL=dunkorslam
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j9k0l1m2n3o4
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j9k0l1m2n3o4
TWITCH_REFRESH=a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j9k0l1m2n3o4p5r6s7q8t9u0w1v2y3z4
TWITCH_BROADCASTER_ID=123456789

The values above are symbolic (exluding "CHANNEL") and you have to change them with the valid ones.

Go to:
https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps

Register a new app.
Name: <Anything>
OAuth Redirect URL: "http://localhost:3000/callback"
Category: Chat Bot
Client Type: Confidential (or leave as is if grayed out)
Client ID (TWITCH_CLIENT_ID): <shown in console>
Client Secret (TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET): Generate new secret

Run "get_tokens.js".
It will print a link.
Open the link in your browser and authorize the app.
The script will automatically update ".env" with:
- TWITCH_OAUTH
- TWITCH_REFRESH

NOTE:
TWITCH_OAUTH is temporary and will be refreshed automatically when expired.

Optional:
Find your broadcaster ID using an online tool.
